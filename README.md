# Larasend

Larasend is a self-hosted transactional email platform for Laravel teams. It gives you a clean HTTP API, dashboard, activity log, API keys, delivery events, suppressions, and a Laravel mail transport while sending through your own Amazon SES account or Cloudflare Email Service.

Larasend is built with Laravel, Inertia, Vue, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker.

## Why Larasend?

- Use Laravel Mail with a Larasend driver instead of wiring every app directly to a provider.
- Keep email activity, previews, headers, metrics, retries, API keys, and suppressions in one place.
- Send through Amazon SES with your own verified domains, configuration sets, and IAM controls, or through Cloudflare Email Service with a single scoped API token.
- Self-host the control plane so your email logs and metadata stay in infrastructure you control.
- Run production with Docker Compose, or hack on the app locally like a normal Laravel project.

## Features

- Simple `POST /api/emails` API with API key authentication.
- Laravel mail transport package for drop-in `MAIL_MAILER=larasend` usage.
- Project-scoped API keys with scopes, expiration, rotation, and last-used metadata.
- Activity dashboard with status filters, search, grouped timeline, inspector preview, headers, metrics, and resend.
- Provider choice per source: Amazon SES or Cloudflare Email Service.
- Inbound email on Cloudflare sources: one click deploys a Worker and routing rule, received mail lands in the dashboard and fires `inbound.received` webhooks.
- Team inbox: inbound and outbound mail threaded into conversations with reply, compose, forward, attachments, rich text, drafts, snooze, internal notes, and keyboard shortcuts.
- SES identity setup with DKIM record guidance; Cloudflare domain verification via DNS checks.
- SES event ingestion for delivery, bounce, complaint, open, click, and suppression events.
- Hourly Cloudflare suppression-list sync (Cloudflare has no event webhooks or open/click tracking).
- Suppression list tracking for bounces and complaints.
- Workspace members and project permissions.
- Source health, provider quota sync, and delivery guardrails for verified domains, suppressions, and complaint rate.
- Docker image and production-ready queue worker setup.

## How It Works

1. Your Laravel app sends mail through the Larasend Laravel transport or directly through the HTTP API.
2. Larasend validates the request, stores the MIME payload and metadata, and queues delivery.
3. The Larasend queue worker sends the raw email through the source's provider — Amazon SES (HTTPS API) or Cloudflare Email Service (authenticated SMTP).
4. SES publishes delivery/bounce/complaint/open/click events back to Larasend through the SES webhook. Cloudflare has no event webhooks: delivery state is recorded at send time and suppressions sync hourly from the Cloudflare account-level list.
5. Larasend updates the activity dashboard, metrics, suppressions, and webhook deliveries.

Larasend accepts API sends even when provider quota sync is stale or temporarily unavailable. The provider remains the final authority for send rejection.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose for the bundled production-style stack.
- PHP 8.4+ and Node.js 22+ for local development.
- PostgreSQL 17+ and Redis 7+.
- An Amazon SES account with a verified sending domain, or a Cloudflare account on the Workers Paid plan with a domain onboarded for Email Sending.

## Laravel Cloud Deployment

Larasend can run on Laravel Cloud, but it needs more than a web service. Provision PostgreSQL and Redis, then configure a queue worker for `php artisan queue:work --queue=default,webhooks --tries=3 --timeout=150` and a scheduler that runs `php artisan schedule:run` every minute. The worker delivers queued email and webhooks; the scheduler handles domain verification, quota refreshes, suppression sync, and retention work.

Configure durable object storage for raw email MIME content. For an S3-compatible disk, set `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3` and `LARASEND_MIME_DISK=s3`, then provide the appropriate `AWS_*` or S3-compatible disk credentials. Do not use a deployment's ephemeral local filesystem for `LARASEND_MIME_DISK`: queued delivery, inbound attachments, and email downloads depend on that content remaining available to every web and worker instance.

Run database migrations as part of each deployment:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

After the first deployment and after operational changes, run the health check from an environment with access to the production services:

```bash
php artisan larasend:doctor
```

Authentication email is deliberately separate from Larasend's transactional provider. The first installation owner and users created while control email is disabled remain accessible without verification. New-user verification, password recovery, and new-member invitations activate only after an administrator sets `LARASEND_CONTROL_MAILER` to a tested, independently configured mailer such as `smtp`, `ses`, `postmark`, or `resend`. `log`, `array`, and `larasend` are rejected as control mailers so the instance is never its own only recovery path.

```env
MAIL_MAILER=log
LARASEND_CONTROL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=...
MAIL_PASSWORD=...
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=accounts@example.com
```

Leave `LARASEND_CONTROL_MAILER` blank until the dedicated mailer is tested. Workspace owners will see a dashboard warning, and invitations that would create an unreachable account are blocked. For emergency recovery, an administrator with shell access can verify an exact account explicitly:

```bash
php artisan larasend:verify-user owner@example.com --force
```

## Quick Start With Docker

Create a deployment directory and download the production files:

```bash
mkdir larasend
cd larasend
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savvyagents/larasend/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/savvyagents/larasend/main/.env.example -o .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://mail.example.com
DB_PASSWORD=change-me
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
SESSION_DRIVER=database
CACHE_STORE=database
```

Generate an application key:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint php app artisan key:generate --show
```

Paste the generated `base64:...` value into `APP_KEY` in `.env`, then start Larasend:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts everything Larasend needs: the web app (which runs migrations automatically on boot), the queue worker, the scheduler for background automation (DNS verification, quota refresh, suppression sync), PostgreSQL, and Redis. Its `.env` defaults use the Compose service names (`postgres` and `redis`) and its named storage volume is suitable for the bundled single-host setup.

Open `APP_URL`, create the first user, and follow onboarding. To confirm the install is healthy:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan larasend:doctor
```

## Amazon SES Setup

Larasend can use stored AWS credentials or, in production, an attached EC2 instance role.

The IAM principal used by Larasend needs SES permissions for:

```text
ses:SendEmail
ses:CreateEmailIdentity
ses:GetEmailIdentity
ses:GetAccount
ses:DeleteSuppressedDestination
```

Recommended setup:

1. Create or choose an SES verified domain, for example `mail.example.com`.
2. In Larasend, add the sending domain and copy the DKIM records.
3. Publish the DNS records in Route 53 or your DNS provider.
4. Configure an SES configuration set if you want event publishing.
5. Point SES/SNS events to the Larasend webhook URL shown in the setup screen.
6. Send a test email from Larasend and confirm delivery activity appears.

## Cloudflare Email Service Setup

Larasend can send through [Cloudflare Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) instead of SES. Sending happens over Cloudflare's authenticated SMTP endpoint; quota and suppressions sync over the Cloudflare REST API.

Requirements:

- The sending domain must be an active zone on your Cloudflare account (Cloudflare DNS).
- The account must be on the Workers Paid plan (includes 3,000 emails/month, then $0.35 per 1,000).
- Email Service is for transactional email only, which matches what Larasend is for.

Inbound email is supported on Cloudflare sources: enabling "Receive email" on a domain deploys a small Cloudflare Worker and points the zone's catch-all routing rule at it, so mail sent to any address on the zone apex lands in the Inbound section and fires `inbound.received` webhooks to your subscribed endpoints. The token additionally needs "Workers Scripts: Edit" and "Email Routing Rules: Edit" for this (added manually; the pre-filled link covers sending only).

Recommended setup:

1. Create an API token with the "Email Sending: Edit", "Zone: Read", and "DNS: Edit" permissions. The Larasend source settings include a pre-filled token creation link.
2. In Larasend, switch the source provider to Cloudflare and save the account ID and API token.
3. Add the sending domain in Larasend. Larasend onboards it for Email Sending through the Cloudflare zone API and publishes the required DNS records automatically; re-check DNS once they propagate.
4. Sync quota, then send a test email.

If you prefer a minimal token with only "Email Sending: Edit", onboard the domain manually in the Cloudflare dashboard (Compute & AI > Email Service > Email Sending) instead — Larasend then only verifies the records via DNS.

Differences from SES to be aware of:

- Cloudflare has no delivery-event webhooks and no open/click tracking. Delivery state is recorded from the SMTP response at send time.
- Suppressions (hard bounces, spam complaints) are managed on Cloudflare's account-level list and sync into Larasend hourly. This requires the Laravel scheduler, which the Docker stack runs automatically as the `scheduler` service; for non-Docker installs run `php artisan schedule:work` or add a cron entry calling `schedule:run`.
- Quota is a daily allowance rather than a rolling 24-hour window.

## Team Inbox

Every project gets a shared inbox at `/projects/{slug}/inbox` where inbound mail and your outbound sends are threaded into conversations (References/In-Reply-To chains first, normalized subject + shared participant as fallback).

- **Reply** goes out as the address the conversation was received on, with proper threading headers so external mail clients keep the thread intact.
- **Compose, forward, attachments** — start new conversations, forward the latest message (original attachments included), attach files up to 10 MB each.
- **Rich text** replies with plain-text alternatives generated automatically; unsent drafts persist locally per thread.
- **Snooze** hides a conversation until later today, tomorrow, or next week — a new inbound message wakes it immediately.
- **Internal notes** annotate the timeline for your team (amber cards, never emailed); read-only members can note even though they cannot send.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `j`/`k` navigate, `e` archive, `u` unread, `r` reply, `f` forward, `c` compose, `/` search.
- `inbound.received` webhook payloads include the conversation's `thread_id`.

Existing mail can be grouped retroactively with `php artisan larasend:thread-backfill`, and `php artisan db:seed --class=InboxDemoSeeder` seeds sample conversations for a demo.

## Sending Email Over HTTP

Create an API key in Larasend, then send:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mail.example.com/api/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ls_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "Acme <notifications@mail.example.com>",
    "to": ["person@example.com"],
    "subject": "Hello from Larasend",
    "html": "<h1>Hello</h1><p>This was sent through Larasend.</p>",
    "text": "Hello. This was sent through Larasend.",
    "tags": {
      "app": "billing"
    }
  }'
```

Supported fields include:

- `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `reply_to`
- `subject`, `html`, `text`
- `template_id`, `variables`
- `attachments` with base64 content
- `headers` for allowed custom headers
- `tags` for searchable metadata

## Laravel Mail Driver

Until the Laravel package is published to Packagist, install it from GitHub.

Add the package repository to your Laravel app's `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/vijaythecoder/larasend-laravel"
        }
    ]
}
```

Install the package:

```bash
composer require larasend/laravel:^0.1
```

Add the mailer to `config/mail.php`:

```php
'larasend' => [
    'transport' => 'larasend',
],
```

Configure your app:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=larasend
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=notifications@mail.example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Acme"

LARASEND_ENDPOINT=https://mail.example.com
LARASEND_API_KEY=ls_your_api_key
LARASEND_TIMEOUT=15
```

Clear cached config:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

Now use Laravel Mail normally:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Mail::raw('Hello from Laravel through Larasend.', function ($message) {
    $message
        ->to('person@example.com')
        ->subject('Larasend test');
});
```

You can also use the client directly:

```php
use Larasend\Laravel\Facades\Larasend;

$email = Larasend::emails()->send([
    'from' => 'Acme <notifications@mail.example.com>',
    'to' => ['person@example.com'],
    'subject' => 'Direct API send',
    'text' => 'Hello from Larasend.',
]);
```

## Local Development

Local development does not use the Docker service names by default. Before running Artisan or `composer run dev` on your host, point `.env` at reachable local PostgreSQL and Redis services (for example, `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1`), and set the matching database credentials. Keep `FILESYSTEM_DISK=local` and `LARASEND_MIME_DISK=local` for disposable development data; use durable object storage only for production.

```bash
composer install
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
npm run dev
```

Or run the bundled development command, which starts the server, queue worker, scheduler, log tail, and Vite together:

```bash
composer run dev
```

The queue worker sends the email; the scheduler drives background automation (DNS verification, quota refresh, Cloudflare suppression sync). If you run processes individually instead of using `composer run dev`, start those two yourself:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
php artisan schedule:work
```

If anything misbehaves, run the health check — it verifies the app key, database, queue worker, scheduler, provider credentials, and domain DNS, and prints the fix next to each failure:

```bash
php artisan larasend:doctor
```

## Building The Docker Image

To build the app locally:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build -d
```

The GitHub workflow publishes images to GitHub Container Registry on pushes to `main` and version tags.

## Verification

Run the same checks used before shipping:

```bash
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
php artisan test --compact
npm run types:check
npm run lint:check
npm run build
```

## Security Notes

- Larasend stores AWS credentials and Cloudflare API tokens encrypted when you choose stored credentials.
- For production on AWS, prefer an instance role or task role over long-lived access keys.
- Scope Cloudflare API tokens to "Email Sending: Edit", "Zone: Read", and "DNS: Edit" (or only "Email Sending: Edit" if you onboard domains manually).
- API keys are only shown once at creation.
- Use project scopes and expiration dates for application API keys.
- Do not expose the SES webhook token publicly beyond the generated webhook URL.

Please report security issues privately before opening a public issue.

## Roadmap

- Packagist release for the Laravel driver.
- More provider adapters beyond Amazon SES and Cloudflare Email Service.
- Cloudflare OAuth as an alternative to pasted API tokens. Deferred because every self-hosted install would first need its own OAuth client registered in the Cloudflare dashboard (redirect URLs are fixed per client), so it adds admin setup before it removes user friction; the token flow needs zero prerequisites.
- Cloudflare delivery-event polling via the GraphQL Analytics API (late bounces and spam flags after the SMTP accept). Deferred because it needs zone-scoped Analytics Read, per-message ID correlation, and only adds marginal signal — Cloudflare has no open/click tracking either way.
- CloudFormation quick-create link for one-click SES IAM setup. Deferred because it requires a project-hosted template outside this repository.
- Deeper per-domain health and deliverability reporting.
- First-class deploy workflow for updating self-hosted Docker installations.
- More template authoring and preview tools.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before opening a PR, run the verification commands above and keep changes focused.

This project follows Laravel conventions closely: controllers stay thin, business logic lives in services/actions, tests use Pest, and frontend pages are built with Inertia and Vue.
